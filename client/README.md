# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## ✅ Educator Dashboard Refactor Summary

### 🎯 Objective
Refactor the educator dashboard endpoint in the LMS project to improve:
- Code **readability**
- Logic **modularity**
- Backend **performance**

---

### 📁 File: `controllers/educatorController.js`

#### 🔄 Before:
- All logic was handled directly in the controller function
- Included inline loops, multiple database queries, and data aggregation
- Used `await` inside a `for` loop, causing slower sequential DB calls

#### ✅ After:
- Replaced raw logic with a clean utility function call:
  ```js
  const dashboardData = await getEducatorDashboardData(educator);
